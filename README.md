# :question: Why?
- It saves time
- Get rid of repetitive commands by automating it
- Organized, so you can eyeball stuff
- Customizable, throw in full port scan, change the wordlist and more

## :question: How?
To run FrontFace
```bash
chmod +x frontface.sh
./frontface.sh 127.0.0.1
```

# :pushpin: What does it do?
- It runs nmap to scan for open ports
- Runs service and version enumeration against those open ports
- If there's _http_ service, runs gobuster
- Cats out the results
- Cheers you up!

## :pushpin: Note:
It relies on following tools:
- Seclists for wordlists
- Nmap
- Gobuster<br>
- _Full port scan is disabled by default, uncomment the code to enable it_

# :hammer: Todo
- Add support for smb enumeration
- Add support for ftp enumueration
